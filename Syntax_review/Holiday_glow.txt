The snowflakes twirl in a dance so light,
Blanketing the world in a robe of white.
The fire crackles, its warmth so near,
Filling the room with holiday cheer.

Stockings hang by the chimney with care,
Dreams of treasures and joys to share.
Laughter rings as the stories unfold,
Memories made, more precious than gold.

Candles flicker, their glow so bright,
Hearts unite on this magical night.
Hereâ€™s to love, joy, and festive delight,
A season of wonder, so merry and bright!
